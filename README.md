The purpose of the project was to identify trends, top selling products, and revenue metrics for business decision-making
Description: In this project, I dived into a large sales dataset to extract valuable insights. I explored sales trends over time, 
identified the best-selling products, calculated revenue metrics such as total sales and profit margins, 
and created visualizations to present my findings effectively. 
This project showcased my ability to manipulate and derive insights from large datasets, enabling me to make data-driven recommendations for optimizing sales strategies![image](https://github.com/AmaPrecious/SALES-DATA-ANALYSIS/assets/155967136/75333b7c-42e4-4f7c-8ff2-d5a83b02a41f)
